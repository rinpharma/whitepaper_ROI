# Pre-Summit: Setting the Stage

## Prepare draft outline

Before the summit, prepare a basic outline or framework for the whitepaper. 

Introduction: Overview of open-source adoption in pharma. Scope of this paper (e.g. clinical trial reporting?)
ROI Breakdown: Benefits (e.g., reduced costs, improved innovation, accelerated research) and time to realisation. 
Use-cases/Examples: 2 x case studies from the pharma.  
Metrics for Success: Quantitative and Qualitative metrics. 
Conclusion and Recommendations.

TODO: Can we share this outline with attendees via email prior to the summit? 

## Identify Key Questions

Candidate questions: 
What are the most compelling benefits of open-source adoption in pharma?
What use cases and evidence exist showing ROI?
What challenges must pharma companies overcome to successfully adopt open-source practices?
How can we measure ROI effectively?

# Interactive Summit Session (1-hour)

### Start with Context (10 minutes):

Begin with a brief presentation introducing the topic, the whitepaperâ€™s purpose, and the outline.

### Collaborative Brainstorming (20 minutes):

Break your audience into smaller groups based on your draft outline sections: e.g., Benefits, Use Cases, Metrics. Assign one topic per group.
Provide prompts for each section (printed or displayed):
"What are the most compelling benefits you've seen or would expect from open-source adoption?"
"Can you name use-case using open-source with measurable ROI?"
"What metrics or KPIs should pharma companies use to measure ROI on open-source?"


### Share Insights (20 minutes):

Have each small group (or individuals) share their top ideas for the assigned section back to the room.

# Post-Conference: Compile Contributions

Gather all ideas, notes, and suggestions from the session. Use this input to flesh out and revise your whitepaper draft. Highlight contributions from the group (with permission) to give credit for their insights.

### Share Progress:

Send a follow-up email to attendees with:

A summary of the session.
A preliminary whitepaper draft that incorporates their insights.
A call to review and provide further input if relevant.
Publish a Collaborative Whitepaper:
