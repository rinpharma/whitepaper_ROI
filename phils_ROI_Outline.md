## Outline I was keeping for a Phuse paper but would be excited to see our Community write it:
# Phil's ROI Paper Outline:

# Intro:

How R Pharma? An Overview of How Our Industry Is Adopting the R
Programming Language

Paper above has:
"Pharmaverse – Why collaborate?
• Streamlined workflows and consistent quality across clinical
reports/submissions
• Facilitate regulatory compliance through standardized packages
• Reduce redundant efforts, increasing efficiency and reducing
costs
• Encourage innovation and rapid problem-solving through shared
knowledge and resources"

Many great reasons to go to Open Source here:

Top reasons by Roche and others: Collaboration

# Big one is Collaboration such as detailed here:

This is the best I know of

# Above are some of the reasons, so how do we Measure success?

There are 1808 issues and 6165 comments in the pharmaverse. There are 205 issues and 1530 in open statsware.
This is amazing

"It cannot be ignored that academia is has been embracing open-source languages for several years...And those leaving academia for industry are typically both well-versed in the use of open-source languages and keen to use them. "

# Another big one is Software Savings:

You don’t have the budget to license an expensive
software platform like Spotfire or Tableau. You don’t
have the headcount to hire SAS programmers and
even if you do, can they turn around results in real
time? So, what I ended up doing was to develop a
set of R code myself or with my statistician (when I
was lucky enough to have one) and produced a set
of plots, such as swimmer plots, waterfall plots, and
so on, to keep our management updated on a weekly
basis. The code took data from EDC and transferred
lab data directly and didn’t rely on CDISC data
resulting in skipping a step in the process to save
time and resources. The key here is that we must
understand the priorities of the company and be creative to overcome the resource constraint

# Other ROIs:

SDTM: The findings indicate that OAK can make SDTM programming up to 3-5 times faster, significantly enhancing efficiency and reducing manual effort.  
https://phuse.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/Archive/2024/Connect/EU/Strasbourg/PAP_SI05.pdf

https://posit.co/blog/open-source-in-pharma-from-five-perspectives/
"The result and benefit: OAK can now automate around 80% of STDM domains with around 22 reusable algorithms. This, in turn, really saved us a lot of time. We’ve seen efficiency gains by at least 50%.”

ADAM:
https://posit.co/blog/admiral-maintainers-interview/
"One of the biggest impacts of admiral, in my experience, is the significant time savings when developing ADaM datasets. Coming from a CRO background, I know that efficiency is a top priority in programming, and admiral plays a crucial role in streamlining the process. Providing standardized functions and workflows helps programmers focus more on data quality and analysis rather than repetitive coding tasks."
