# Pre-Summit: Setting the Stage

## Prepare draft outline

Before the summit, prepare a basic outline or framework for the whitepaper. 

TODO: Can we share this outline with attendees via email prior to the summit? 

## Goal of Summit

Craft an ROI pitch for different personas:
- The established SAS developer
- The early career R developer
- CFO / Finance
- Head of Biometrics / Programming
- Head of Clinical Development
- Regulatory Affairs Executive 

# Interactive Summit Session (1-hour)

### Start with Context (10 minutes):

Begin with a brief presentation introducing the topic, the whitepaper’s purpose, and the outline.

### Craft your pitch (20 minutes):

Break into 6 groups. 
- You have 20 minutes to craft a 90-second pitch.  
- You’re not selling open-source — you’re selling the impact.
- Your pitch must be strategic, not technical.
- Your pitch should resonate with the persona. 


### Share Insights (20 minutes):

Have each small group (or individuals) share their 90s pitch. 

# Post-Conference: Compile Contributions

Gather all ideas, notes, and suggestions from the session. Use this input to flesh out and revise your whitepaper draft. Highlight contributions from the group (with permission) to give credit for their insights.

### Share Progress:

Send a follow-up email to attendees with:

A summary of the session.
A preliminary whitepaper draft that incorporates their insights.
A call to review and provide further input if relevant.
Publish a Collaborative Whitepaper:
