# Background

- brief intro of open-source adoption in clinical trial reporting
- Often driven by risk mitigation:
    - talent pool 
    - dynamic data viz
    - opportunity for cross-industry collaboration
    - interoperability (AI)
    - reduced vendor lock in

# Return on Investment

## End-user perspective
We could further split this into personas?   

Keeping it general for now: 

- develop transferable skills 
    - usage of industry-wide tools and languages such a git, R
    - adopt to modern ways of working (agile, best practices)

- contribute to the community
    - share your work publicly

## Business perspective

- Efficiency
    - reduced single-use code
    - shared development and shared maintenance (we could use some of James' material here on commits, issues)

- Quality
    - crowdsourced testing and issue tracking
    - pan-study code is seen by "many eyes"

- Talent
    - minimise upskilling as tools are shared across companies
    - mechanism for knowledge transfer

- Transparency
    - tools are developed and evolve in the public domain
