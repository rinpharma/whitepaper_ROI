# Introduction

- brief intro of open-source adoption in clinical trial reporting
- Often driven by risk mitigation:
    - talent pool 
    - dynamic data viz
    - opportunity for cross-industry collaboration
    - interoperability (AI)
    - reduced vendor lock in

# The journey to ROI

## Upfront investment

What do we need to support to realise ROI? 

| **Area**             | **Investment Type**                                 |

| Process & Validation | SOPs, validation frameworks, audit-readiness        |
| Infrastructure       | Modern IDEs, CI/CD, version control, high performance / cloud compute|
| Governance           | Strategy, KPIs, leadership buy-in                   |
| Piloting             | Targeted use cases, evaluation metrics              |

## Return on Investment

Options:  
    (1) Break into hard vs soft metrics?  
    (2) Break into end-user vs biz perspective? 
    (3) Should we discuss the time horizon?


### Tangible benefits (hard metrics)

- Cost
    - No licensing fee for programming languages

- Efficiency
    - reduced single-use code
    - reduced *time-to-insight*
    - shared development and shared maintenance
    - automate document development (e.g. quarto)
    - native parellelisation

- Quality
    - crowdsourced testing and issue tracking
    - pan-study code is seen by "many eyes"

- Talent
    - talent pool who already know the tools 
    - mechanism for knowledge transfer

### Intangible benefits (soft metrics)

- Transparency
    - tools are developed and evolve in the public domain

- Innovation
    - ecosystem enables fast-paced development in an open, collaborative manner 

- Talent attraction and retention

- Develop transferable skills 
    - usage of industry-wide tools and languages such a git, R
    - adopt to modern ways of working (agile, best practices)

- Community engagement 
    - share your work publicly
